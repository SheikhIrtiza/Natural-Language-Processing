**Natural Language Processing (NLP) Toolkit README**
***Overview***
This repository contains code snippets and examples utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. NLTK is a powerful library for working with human language data and provides functionalities for tasks such as tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging.

**Contents**
**Tokenization**

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual units, such as sentences or words.

**Stop Word Removal**

Stop words are common words with little meaning, often removed to focus on important content.

**Stemming**

Stemming involves reducing words to their root or base form by removing suffixes.
**Stop Word Removal** (Alternative)

Another approach to stop word removal using NLTK's built-in stop words set.
**Lemmatization**

Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form.
**Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**

POS tagging involves labeling words with their grammatical categories.
